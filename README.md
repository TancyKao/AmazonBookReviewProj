Without experience of product commonalities, customers will heavily rely on other reviewers for the decision making for the online shopping. However, with amount of information from reviewers, it is important for a website to identify the useful, valid, and reliable reviews to save help customers. Useful reviews also can in turn to help business to improve their products and understand customers' need.
